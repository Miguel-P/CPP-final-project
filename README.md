# CPP-final-project
This was the final project done for a 2nd year, 8 credit, C++ module. The aim was to create a program which maintains a CSV file. 

The eLog application will open a specified CSV file (or create an entirely new one) and load the contents of the file as a series of log 
entries. Each entry, which corresponds to a line of the CSV file, has a priority number, followed by a comma, followed by notes and is 
terminated by a newline character. It needs to support the following functions:

1) Add new log entries to the file. I.e. specifying a priority, followed by some notes.

2) List all entries in the file

3) List all entries with a particular priority number

4) Search for an entry using a keyword 

5) Deleting the nth entry from the log (where 1 corresponds to the first entry)

6) Save newly added entries to the CSV file

The project outline also showed an example of how the user should be able to interact with each function on the console:
