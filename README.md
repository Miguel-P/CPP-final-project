# CPP-final-project
This was the final project done for a 2nd year, 8 credit, C++ module. The aim was to create a program which maintains a CSV file. 

The eLog application will open a specified CSV file (or create an entirely new one) and load the contents of the file as a series of log 
entries. Each entry, which corresponds to a line of the CSV file, has a priority number, followed by a comma, followed by notes and is 
terminated by a newline character. It needs to support the following functions:

1) Add new log entries to the file. I.e. specifying a priority, followed by some notes.

2) List all entries in the file

3) List all entries with a particular priority number

4) Search for an entry using a keyword 

5) Deleting the nth entry from the log (where 1 corresponds to the first entry)

6) Save newly added entries to the CSV file

This is what the program looks like on the console:

This is a side by side image of what the Add Entries and Listing All Entries function looks like:

I received 88% for the project. Most of the marks were lost due to poor commenting and an untidy flowchart.
