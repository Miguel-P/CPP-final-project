# CPP-final-project
This was the final project done for a 2nd year, 8 credit, C++ module. The aim was to create a program which maintains a CSV file. 

The eLog application will open a specified CSV file (or create an entirely new one) and load the contents of the file as a series of log 
entries. Each entry, which corresponds to a line of the CSV file, has a priority number, followed by a comma, followed by notes and is 
terminated by a newline character. It needs to support the following functions:

1) Add new log entries to the file. I.e. specifying a priority, followed by some notes.

2) List all entries in the file

3) List all entries with a particular priority number

4) Search for an entry using a keyword 

5) Deleting the nth entry from the log (where 1 corresponds to the first entry)

6) Save newly added entries to the CSV file

This is what the program looks like on the console:

This is a side by side image of what the Add Entries and Listing All Entries function looks like:

I received 88% for the project. Most of the marks were lost due to poor commenting and an untidy flowchart. There are some definite bugs 
and there should also be more code to catch exceptions and recover gracefully in the main.cpp
